# serverside-story

This is a WIP fork of adarkroom, which you can find upstream.
This fork attempts to use the engine of adarkroom to transform it into something else.

## Quick Start

If yo want to have a look at the code or app, clone the repo, do `npm install` (it's just express for the development webserver. You cant then do `node dev-server.js` and open `localhost:8081`.

## Contributing

Make an issue before starting. Fork the project. Work in a feature branch.
Right now it will probably be difficult to know what needs to be done since it is still not documented well enough and doesn't function as working prototype yet.
